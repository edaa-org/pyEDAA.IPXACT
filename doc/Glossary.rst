   IP-XACT

     IP-XACT is an XML format that defines and describes individual, re-usable electronic circuit designs (individual
     pieces of intellectual property, or IPs) to facilitate their use in creating integrated circuits (i.e. microchips).
     IP-XACT was created by the `SPIRIT Consortium <https://www.accellera.org/>`__ as a standard to enable automated
     configuration and integration through tools. |br|
