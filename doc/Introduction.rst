Introduction
############

*pyEDAA.IPXACT* provides a Document Object Model (DOM) for reading and writing IP-XACT XML files.

.. attention::

   As IP-XACT defines a gigantic data model, only a portion of this data model is currently implemented. The
   implementation focuses on the most valuable parts. Contributions are welcome.


.. _INTRO/History:

History
=======

The beginnings of this EDA² layer were released as :pypi:`pyIPXACT`. The package was then integrated into the EDA² layer
family and renamed to pyEDAA.IPXACT. The embedded XML schema definitions are provided by
`Accellera <https://www.accellera.org/>`__. As these schema files might be interesting for other users too, they have
been extracted and provided in a standalone repository called :gh:`edaa-org/IPXACT-Schema`.
